Hello World

Research Interests:

# My research aims to build data-driven computer systems to make Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) more secure and more efficient. I have been looking into multiple CPS research problems, such as system sustainability, data privacy, and system security in CPS at different scales, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing devices, smart homes, smart energy systems, and smart cities.

# My work has been spanning multiple technical fields, including Big Data Analytics, Distributed and Tiny Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Image Processing, and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning. Recently, my research has also been applied in data analytics and cybersecurity in multiple CPS application domains, including Smart and Connected Communities, Maritime Transportation System, underwater cyberinfrastructure, and Personal Home Health Monitoring. I open-source all the systems (including their evaluation datasets) I build.

* I am looking for one outstanding PhD student (current senior/master student) to join my research projects. Please send me your CV, transcripts, and writing samples (explaining why PhD and why us).
