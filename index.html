<h2>About me</h2>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<p> I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor in CS department at Colorado School of Mines. I received my Ph.D. from University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst) in 2018 under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://www.davidirwin.info/">David Irwin</a>.  At Colorado School of Mines, I lead the <a href="https://cps.mines.edu/">Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory (CPSLab)</a>, which focuses on designing data-driven computer systems with an emphasis on improving Cybersecurity, User Privacy and Sustainability of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT). On my recent CPS/IoT privacy systems research, I received the NSF CAREER Award from the Computer Systems Research (CSR) program in the Division of Computer and Network Systems in 2023. I am a full member of Sigma Xi, and a member of ACM, AAAI and IEEE. I also worked as Unix Software Engineer in industry for two years.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<div class="infoblock">
<div class="blockcontent">
<ul>
<li><p> My research aims to <font color=black><b>build data-driven experimental computer systems</b></font> to make  <font color=black><b>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)</b></font> more <font color=black><b>energy-efficient</b></font> and more <font color=black><b>secure</b></font>. I have been looking into multiple CPS research problems, such as system sustainability, data privacy, and system security in CPS at different scales, such as the IoT and Edge Computing devices, smart homes and buildings, renewable energy systems, smart grids, and smart cities.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> My work has been spanning multiple technical fields, including <i>AI@Edge</i>, <i>Big Data Analytics</i>, <i>Distributed and Tiny Machine Learning</i>, <i>Federeated/Split Learning</i>, <i>Image Processing</i>, and <i>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</i>. Recently, my research has also been applied in data analytics and cybersecurity in multiple CPS application domains, including Smart and Connected Communities, Maritime Transportation System, underwater cyberinfrastructure, and Personal Home Health Monitoring. I <a href="https://github.com/cyber-physical-systems/">open-source</a> all the systems (including their evaluation datasets) I build.</p>
